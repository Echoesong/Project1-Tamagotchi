# Tamagotchi

## Description
 This is a version of the once-popular handheld game **Tamagotchi.** In it, you care for a creature named Pixel by feeding and playing with them to keep their hunger and happiness meters high. If you care for them long enough, they will grow to love you and you will 'win' the game. If you do not take care of them and their health drops to 0, they will die and the game will end.
